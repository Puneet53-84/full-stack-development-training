<h2>Stacey Little – From Trailer Park to Seven-Figure Food Blog(Another Blog Post)</h2>
<p>Content of the second blog post.</p>
<h3>Content Overview:</h3>
<p>Stacey Little, founder of the food blog Southern Bite, shares his remarkable journey in a Business Insider essay titled “I was raised in a trailer park and declared bankruptcy the day my son was born. Now, I run a million‑dollar business.” He candidly recounts growing up in poverty, living in a trailer park, and experiencing financial hardship from youth—often facing bullying and uncertainty.<br/><br/>

    Despite a difficult start, Stacey persevered: he earned a college degree, worked at a nonprofit, and later filed for bankruptcy on the day his son was born in 2008. Amid crisis, he started Southern Bite as a side project, writing restaurant reviews and sharing recipes. The blog gained traction and eventually led to a cookbook deal. When he lost his nonprofit job, he decided to fully commit to blogging—and it blossomed into a seven-figure business with a custom test kitchen, office, and studio at home.<br/><br/>
    Today, Stacey emphasizes the importance of perspective and giving back—teaching his son responsibility, helping his mother buy a house, and highlighting how food can build community and connection.</p><br/>
